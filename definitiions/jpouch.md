In certain cases of ulcerative colitis, the entire colon is surgically removed (colectomy)
and the small bowel (ileum) is brought down and turned into an internal J-shaped pouch or
reservoir to hold stool, and joined to the anus. This surgery is typically performed in 2
stages (colectomy with creation of J-pouch and a diverting ileostomy; reversal of diverting
ileostomy) although sometimes it is done in 3 stages (colectomy with end ileostomy and the
rectal stump is left inside; removal of rectal stump, creation of J-pouch and a diverting
ileostomy; reversal of diverting ileostomy).
