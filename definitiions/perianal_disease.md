Inflammation at or near the anus, including tags, fissures, fistulae, abscesses, or stenosis. When abscesses form around the anus due to Crohnâ€™s disease, they need to be incised (cut open) and drained. Fistulas between the rectum and vagina may develop. For fistulas, if they are quite active or repeatedly form abscesses, surgeons may insert a seton (plastic band) to keep the tract open to prevent the formation of abscesses.
