<h1>Infant Health and Vaccinations</h1>

IBD medications generally are not known to adversely affect the baby in the future in terms of organ development including immune system development or risk of infection (with the exception of methotrexate). There may be an impact on which vaccinations your infant can receive in the first year of life (just like medications may impact which vaccinations you can receive)

The recommendations provided below are based on information available up to 2021. It is suggested that such recommendations are discussed further with your treating physician's

**Biologics specific information:**

Unlike other medications, biologics are antibodies. Just like the antibodies a mother transfers naturally to her baby during pregnancy, biologics do cross the placenta and enter the babyâ€™s blood stream.

The biologic can start actively crossing the placenta from the second trimester in pregnancy with the majority of the transfer occurring in the third trimester. As a result, your baby may be born with the biologic detectable in their blood.

Similar recommendations have been made for all groups of biologics based on the information currently available. However, the anti-TNF group of biologics has been used in IBD for longer than other groups and as a result, there is more information available regarding the use of anti-TNFs in pregnancy and breastfeeding.  

**Vaccinations:**

The medications a mother takes during pregnancy may affect whether or not the baby can receive certain vaccinations. While we recommend that decisions regarding medication choices in pregnancy are made independently to the effects on infant vaccination safety, knowledge regarding safe vaccination practices is important. 

If exposed to a biologic in pregnancy, your infant cannot receive live vaccines for the 12 months of life. If a baby has rotavirus associated diarrhea, parents need to take precautions when doing diaper/nappy changes, in particular thoroughly washing hands with soap and water following the change.

**Infections:**

Safety data is reassuring for biologic use in pregnancy. 

It is important to note that there is only limited experience with the newer biologics such as ustekinumab and vedolizumab.
