# Medications - Pregnancy
Information regarding the use of your regular medications during pregnancy is listed below.
It may be that your regular IBD medications need to be changed during pregnancy due to a flare. Having a plan in place in case you do have a flare is recommended - this can be discussed with your IBD specialist and shared with those involved in your obstetric care. 

If you need to start a biologic in pregnancy, these can be started at any time in pregnancy.  There is limited information about small molecule use in pregnancy. Your specialist may need to consider a small molecule in exceptional circumstances, which will require a thorough discussion with your specialists. 
Your obstetric provider may recommend starting aspirin in pregnancy to prevent pre-term pre-eclampsia (a pregnancy related condition which causes high blood pressure and possible organ damage). Studies have shown that aspirin is considered safe in inflammatory bowel disease.
