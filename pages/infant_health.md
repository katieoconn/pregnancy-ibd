<h1>Infant Health and Vaccinations</h1>

IBD medications generally are not known to adversely affect the baby in the future in terms of organ development including immune system development or risk of infection (with the exception of methotrexate). There may be an impact on which vaccinations your infant can receive in the first year of life (just like medications may impact which vaccinations you can receive)

The recommendations provided below are based on information available up to 2021. It is suggested that such recommendations are discussed further with your treating physician's

**Biologics specific information:**

Unlike other medications, biologics are antibodies. Just like the antibodies a mother transfers naturally to her baby during pregnancy, biologics do cross the placenta and enter the babyâ€™s blood stream.

The biologic can start actively crossing the placenta from the second trimester in pregnancy with the majority of the transfer occurring in the third trimester. As a result, your baby may be born with the biologic detectable in their blood.

**Vaccinations:**

The medications a mother takes during pregnancy may affect whether or not the baby can receive certain vaccinations. While we recommend that decisions regarding medication choices in pregnancy are made independently to the effects on infant vaccination safety, knowledge regarding safe vaccination practices is important. 

If exposed to a biologic in pregnancy, your infant cannot receive live vaccines for the first 6 months of life. An exception is rotavirus vaccine, which can be given according to the local schedule. If a baby has rotavirus vaccine associated diarrhoea, parents need to take precautions when doing diaper/nappy changes, in particular thoroughly washing hands with soap and water following the change. The medications a mother takes during pregnancy may affect whether or not the baby can receive certain vaccinations. There are inactive and live vaccines; live vaccines contain a weak version of the actual virus. Regardless of which medication the baby was exposed to during pregnancy, inactive vaccines can be given according to the schedule.

If exposed to small molecules in pregnancy, your infant cannot receive live vaccines for the first one week of life.

Please discuss the decisions regarding vaccinations for your infant with your infant provider.

**Infections:**

Safety data is reassuring for biologic use in pregnancy. 


Further information regarding infection risk for your listed IBD medications are shown below.

## **Breastfeeding**
Some women may be in a position to breastfeed. Breastfeeding a baby will help support the health of your child today and in the future. There is also evidence that babies who are fed only breastmilk for the first six months of life will have a lower risk of developing ear infections, respiratory illnesses and diarrhoea. They are also less likely to have lifelong conditions like allergies and asthma. 

Women who are taking medication to manage IBD while they are breastfeeding are often concerned that the medication may harm their babies. In most cases, the concentration of medicine that passes through to the breastmilk is very small and women should feel comfortable continuing to take IBD medications while breastfeeding with the exception of methotrexate, Jak inhibitors and S1P modulators. 

Information specific your listed medications is provided below.

## **Formula Feeding**

Some women choose not to breastfeed, or may not be able to breastfeed for a variety of reasons (insufficient milk supply, health condition, etc.). Women with IBD should discuss their options with their healthcare team.
