<h1>Introduction to Pregnancy & IBD Decision Aid</h1>

If you are a woman living with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), you are in a unique position when it comes to pregnancy. 
You need to know that, in general, the likelihood of you becoming pregnant and having a healthy pregnancy and baby are similar to other women not living with the disease. 
Women living with IBD and their healthcare teams need to work together from a common base of understanding.

The Pregnancy and IBD Decision Aid (myPIDA) has been created to help women like you, who are living with IBD and thinking about having a child, maximize their health and the health of their babies through making informed decisions about: 

* Timing of becoming pregnant
* Your IBD management during pregnancy 

This decision aid will walk you through questions about you, your life and your health. You can then move through each information module as the tool guides you, or on your own by clicking modules of interest listed in the subject navigation bar. Please note that the information you provide is for use in the decision aid, however it will not be automatically sent to your healthcare team. We encourage you to discuss the information provided and questions that may be generated with your healthcare team. It may be useful to print the Summary page and take this with you to your Gastroenterologist and/or Obstetrician Appointment. 

Definitions for certain IBD related terms are available if the term is shown in purple (by clicking on this word, a definition becomes available on the right hand side of the page). 

The following sources of financial support have been received for myPIDA:
Women and Children's Health Research Institute (WCHRI) Clinical/Community Research Integration Support Program (CRISP); Merck Better Care, Healthy Communities Funding Program; Gastroenterological Society of Australia Rose Amarant Grant
