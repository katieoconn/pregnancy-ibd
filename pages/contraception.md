<h1>Contraception</h1>

Women with active IBD can still become pregnant, therefore, while you are still deciding whether or not you want to get pregnant, you may wish to consider using contraception. 

Please speak to your family physician, gastroenterologist or gynecologist regarding which type of contraception would be best, as some may have hormones that may affect your IBD, and your IBD (especially if active) may affect absorption of oral contraceptives.

The following table outlines existing concerns regarding different methods of contraception in IBD. Such concerns though are based on limited available information.
