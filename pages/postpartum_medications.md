# Medications - Post Partum

After delivery, you may need to take medications for various reasons; if you are unsure, please speak with your physician(s).   These medications may include pain medications and IBD medications.

## **Pain Medications**

It is not uncommon to have pain after vaginal delivery or C-section.     After vaginal delivery, women may have pain from breast engorgement, uterine contractions, perineal lacerations.   After C-section, women may have pain from the surgical wound.   Non-opioid analgesics such as acetaminophen and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are recommended first.  If required, stronger medications including opioids or opioids in combination with acetaminophen or NSAID can be used with guidance from your health care providers.

***NSAIDS***: NSAIDS may trigger flares in some people with IBD and may cause gastrointestinal complications (dyspepsia, ulcer, gastrointestinal bleeding).     NSAIDS are excreted into breast milk but in very low concentrations, and considered safe to continue in breast feeding.  Ibuprofen is the preferred first-line agent because of short half-life and very low concentrations in the breast milk.  

***Opioids*** : Opioid medications (e.g. codeine, morphine, hydromorphone, fentanyl) have an effect on the mother's central nervous system (CNS) and may result in CNS depression (grogginess, sleepiness).   Opioids are transferred into the breast milk and may affect the breast fed infant (excessive sedation and depressed respiration).  Therefore opioids should be taken for the shortest duration of time possible, and only when prescribed and monitored by a physician.  

Shared decision-making is best when it comes to pain control postpartum.

## **IBD Medications**

There is a risk of flaring observed within 3 months postpartum.  Therefore, it is important to ensure you are on any necessary IBD medications post partum.

If you were on IBD medications throughout pregnancy to keep your disease in remission, you should continue post partum.

***Biologics:***
If you were on a biologic and temporarily held it or delayed a dose in the last trimester of pregnancy, you are likely due for a dose after delivery.

It is recommended to discuss youâ€™re your prescribing gastroenterology and obstetric teams about when to take post delivery dose. 
If the timing of your biologic dose after delivery has not been arranged, please speak with your gastroenterologist, IBD nurse, or biologic program coordinator.
