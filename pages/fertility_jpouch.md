**J pouch (IPAA)**

A J pouch usually involves two to three operations, including removal of the rectum and colon. The surgery to remove the rectum can reduce fertility. Therefore, the timing of the stages to create a J pouch is important to discuss with your specialists. If you have had this surgery, and are having troubles conceiving, please contact your specialists regarding options for fertility therapy including invitro fertilisation (IVF).
