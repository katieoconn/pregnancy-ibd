**Colectomy**

A sub-total or partial colectomy does not affect fertility however if the rectum is removed (referred to as proctectomy) this can reduce fertility. Therefore, if you require removal of the rectum, please discuss potential impact on fertility with your specialists. If you have had this surgery, and are having troubles conceiving, please contact your specialists regarding options for fertility therapy specifically in vitro fertilisation (IVF).
