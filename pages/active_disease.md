<h1>Disease Activity</h1>

**Active disease (or Flare)**: when tissues are inflamed and irritated; this may or may not be causing symptoms 

**Inactive disease (or Remission)**: when there is minimal tissue inflammation

## **Will my IBD Affect Pregnancy or the Baby?**

Compared with the general population, women living with IBD may have a slightly increased risk of the complications. 

The risk of complications during pregnancy further increases if your IBD is not under control. Such complications include losing the baby or having a premature or low birth weight baby

**Pre-term births** (before 37 weeks gestation) estimated to occur in:

* 5 of every 100 births (in women with **inactive IBD**) vs. 15 of every 100 births (in women with **active IBD**)<sup>1</sup>

Infants born prematurely have difficulty with breathing, temperature regulation and feeding and are prone to infections. Additionally, preterm birth can cause complications of the heart, eyes, brain and bowel.  This can result in a prolonged hospital stay with long term motor and developmental disabilities. 

**Low birth weight** (2500g or 5.5 lbs) estimated to occur in:

* 3 of every 100 births (in women with **inactive IBD**) vs. 10 of every 100 births (in women with **active IBD**)<sup>1</sup>

Women with active IBD in pregnancy can have up to 4 times the risk of having an infant with low birth weight, compared to women with inactive IBD in pregnancy.<sup>3</sup>
Low birth weight can be associated with cognitive and developmental disorders.<sup>1</sup>

**Loss of pregnancy** (miscarriage or spontaneous abortion) estimated to occur in:

* 10 of every 100 births (in women with **inactive IBD**) vs. 30 of every 100 births (in women with **active IBD**)<sup>2</sup>

**Congenital malformations** (conditions or defects that affect the baby from birth and usually throughout their life)
* IBD in general does not increase the likelihood of congenital malformations. 

## **Will Pregnancy Affect my IBD?**
Women with IBD who have active disease in the 6 months preconception may have up to 5 fold increased risk of active disease during pregnancy.<sup>4</sup>

Of women who have active disease at the time of conception, two in three are likely to have active disease, and one in three are likely to go into remission.   

On the other hand, of women who are in remission at the time of conception, two in three are likely to stay in remission, and one in three have a flare

Women with ulcerative colitis may have a higher risk of flaring during pregnancy than women with Crohnâ€™s disease.   

In general, it is recommended to try to be in remission at the time of conception for better chances of staying well in pregnancy. 

## **Is my IBD Active or Not?**

There are several tests that can be done to determine if your disease is active (flaring) or inactive (in remission) before you get pregnant. 
Your doctor may recommend you have one of the following tests to determine if you are in truly in remission before you get pregnant: 
* Blood tests (note: CRP can increase in pregnancy; albumin and iron levels can decrease in pregnancy)
* Fecal calprotectin stool test can indicate if your disease is active or becoming active. It is a useful test to have checked before pregnancy and monitored during pregnancy as studies show the fecal calprotectin is not significantly increased due to pregnancy alone. 
* Ultrasound of intestines 

* Flexible sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy
* CT or MRI

Be sure to advise the doctor or technician if you are trying to conceive or may be pregnant, as endoscopic or imaging tests may need to be delayed or modified
