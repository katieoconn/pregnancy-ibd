**SMOKING**

Smoking can reduce fertility, and increase the risk of miscarriage, stillbirth, preterm premature rupture of membranes, low birth weight, placental abruption/previa, preterm birth, and sudden infant death syndrome. One of the harms associated with smoking during pregnancy in the general population is a significant reduction in babyâ€™s birthweight. This has also been shown specifically within an IBD population (with a 274 grams reduction shown in a Danish population).
