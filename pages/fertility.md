<h1>Fertility</h1>

Fertility is generally not affected by IBD, excluding if your IBD is active or if you have had certain surgeries in the past.
Women who have inactive IBD are as likely to become pregnant as women who do not have IBD. Women who have active IBD may find it more difficult to become pregnant. Therefore, it is recommended that you be in steroid-free remission for at least 3 to 6 months prior to attempting to become pregnant. 

Surgery may be required for the management of IBD. Some surgeries such as removal of the rectum (proctectomy) can affect fertility. If you would like to find out more information for specific surgeries, you can choose surgical types on the "Tell Us About You" page, Surgery section

Fertility is multifactorial, and many factors not related to your IBD such as age, comorbidities, medications, smoking, can affect fertility. Voluntary childlessness can also decrease fertility. We hope that PIDA can hopefully reduce the voluntary childlessness aspect and modifiable factors such as stopping smoking.
